## Iris Flower Classification

### Overview
This project involved building a model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. It was a straightforward classification problem that helped reinforce my understanding of fundamental machine learning concepts.

### Data
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. No significant preprocessing was required, making it a clean and ideal dataset for classification tasks.

### Models and Techniques
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Cross-validation for model tuning

### Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 96%, demonstrating the effectiveness of simple yet powerful classification algorithms on well-structured datasets.
